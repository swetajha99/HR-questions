Biggest weakness?

->Because I like to work independently and quickly, It has been challenging for me to ask for help when needed. But now I have been pushing myself to approach the subject matter expert and ask them for specific knowledge that can improve my work 
Or 
My biggest weakness has been sometimes I get too much into the details of a project or understanding any particular concept and spend time analyzing the smallest things but recently I started a way to keep a check on myself regularly and try to focus on the bigger picture so that I can ensure quality but also meet the deadline.

How do you approach problem-solving and decision-making in a technical context?
->I like to build myself a roadmap to approach for such situations.
I Start by clearly defining the problem and the desired outcome. Gather all the necessary information and data related to the problem.
Break down the problem into smaller components and analyze each one.
Brainstorm and generate as many possible solutions as possible.
Choose the most feasible and effective solution based on the evaluation criteria.
Assign tasks to the relevant team members and communicate the plan effectively.
Monitor the implementation of the solution and evaluate its effectiveness.


Biggest strength:
-> being an organized person both mentally and physically has been one of my biggest strengths throughout my college life, though in my workplace I wasnt assigned much responsibilities but whatever was assigned I tried doing it with all the dedication. Back in college I was a part of few clubs. I balanced my assignment deadlines, club meetings and a part time job throughout my college. I know this role will involve a lot of unexpected challenges where I will be expected to showcase my organisational skills and adapt quickly. So I believe I have a lot to offer.
